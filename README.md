# RINF-TWG-CCS
Modelisation of CCS aspects in OP and SoL (as per micro-level ontology)

## Objectives
This repository collects the code samples for the Chapter 4 of the TWG RINF CCS working group final report, strictly based on the [ERA Vocabulary](https://github.com/Interoperable-data/ERA_vocabulary) and [SKOS Concepts](https://data-interop.era.europa.eu/era-vocabulary/skos/index.html), with the updates as per WG 2024.

1. Expressing physical units in RINF, although these will be considered mainly internally at EU AR.
2. Signal & Non-stopping areas, and especially (4.2.3) the types and the modelling on micro-level
3. Areas of implementation (GSM-R)
